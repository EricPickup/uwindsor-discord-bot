# Commands and Features

This file contains information about the various features available on our bot.

## Art

The `art` command allows users to send pre-created ASCII art. Think of it like a huge sticker.

## Equation

The `equation` command allows users to render LaTeX math into an image.

## Free

A joke command, paired with [`jail`](#jail), that allows you to "release" a user from jail.

## Jail

A joke command, paired with [`free`](#free), that allows you to mock a user by "putting them behind bars".

## Pong

The `pong` command literally just has the bot reply `PONG`. Useful when bored, or when you need to check if the bot is online.

## Prompt

The `prompt` command allows designated users to have the bot ask questions in a dedicated channel. We use this command to spark interaction between community members.

## Purge

The `purge` command allows designated users to have the bot mass-delete messages from a channel. We use this command to clean up after "spam attacks".

## Say

The `say` command is similar to [`prompt`](#prompt), but allows the channel to be configured. This is mostly a command for privilleged users to mess around with.

## Whereis

The `whereis` command allows students to find the location of a building on campus by getting a campus map with the building highlighted.

## Year

The `year` command is currently unsupported, as we use another bot in its place. Formerly, it allowed users to give themselves a role that indicated which year they are in.

## Google

The `google` command allows students to google information directly inside the discord, this is useful for finding information while engaged in conversation.
